        The first high-level programming language was Plankalkül, created by
        Konrad Zuse between 1942 and 1945. The first high-level language to have
        an associated compiler was created by Corrado Böhm in 1951, for his PhD
        thesis. The first commercially available language was FORTRAN (FORmula
        TRANslation); developed in 1956 (first manual appeared in 1956, but
        first developed in 1954) by a team led by John Backus at IBM.

      <p>
        When FORTRAN was first introduced it was treated with suspicion because
        of the belief that programs compiled from high-level language would be
        less efficient than those written directly in machine code. FORTRAN
        became popular because it provided a means of porting existing code to
        new computers, in a hardware market that was rapidly evolving; the
        language eventually became known for its efficiency.

        Below is a list of more modern programming languages that have since
        evolved from these early languages.

        Java

      <p>
        Java is a set of computer software and specifications developed by James
        Gosling at Sun Microsystems, which was later acquired by the Oracle
        Corporation, that provides a system for developing application software
        and deploying it in a cross-platform computing environment. Java is used
        in a wide variety of computing platforms from embedded devices and
        mobile phones to enterprise servers and supercomputers. Java applets,
        which are less common than standalone Java applications, were commonly
        run in secure, sandboxed environments to provide many features of native
        applications through being embedded in HTML pages. It's still possible
        to run Java in web browsers after most of them having dropped support
        for Java's VM.

        C was originally developed at Bell Labs by Dennis Ritchie between 1972
        and 1973 to make utilities running on Unix. Later, it was applied to
        re-implementing the kernel of the Unix operating system.[6] During the
        1980s, C gradually gained popularity. Nowadays, it is one of the most
        widely used programming languages, with C compilers from various vendors
        available for the majority of existing computer architectures and
        operating systems. C has been standardized by the ANSI since 1989 (see
        ANSI C) and subsequently by the International Organization for
        Standardization.

        C++ is primarily C but has some differences within its syntax. The core
        difference between the two is that C++ is object oriented.

        C# was designed by Anders Hejlsberg, and its development team is
        currently led by Mads Torgersen. The most recent version is C# 7.3,
        which was released in 2018 alongside Visual Studio 2017 version 15.7.2.

      <p>Here is an example of Hello World in C#:</p>

        The name "C sharp" was inspired by the musical notation where a sharp
        indicates that the written note should be made a semitone higher in
        pitch. This is similar to the language name of C++, where "++" indicates
        that a variable should be incremented by 1 after being evaluated. The
        sharp symbol also resembles a ligature of four "+" symbols (in a
        two-by-two grid), further implying that the language is an increment of
        C++.

        Python

      <p>
        Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming
        language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991,
        Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable
        use of significant whitespace. Its language constructs and
        object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical
        code for small and large-scale projects.
      </p>
      <code>#!/usr/bin/env python print "Hello World"</code>
      <p>
        Python was conceived in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC
        language. Python 2.0, released 2000, introduced features like list
        comprehensions and a garbage collection system capable of collecting
        reference cycles. Python 3.0, released 2008, was a major revision of the
        language that is not completely backward-compatible, and much Python 2
        code does not run unmodified on Python 3. Due to concern about the
        amount of code written for Python 2, support for Python 2.7 (the last
        release in the 2.x series) was extended to 2020. Language developer
        Guido van Rossum shouldered sole responsibility for the project until
        July 2018 but now shares his leadership as a member of a five-person
        steering council.

        Pascal

      <p>
        Pascal is an imperative and procedural programming language, designed by
        Niklaus Wirth as a small, efficient language intended to encourage good
        programming practices using structured programming and data structuring.
        It is named in honor of the French mathematician, philosopher and
        physicist Blaise Pascal.
      </p>
      <code>program HelloWorld(output); begin writeln('Hello World') end.</code>
      <p>
        Pascal was developed on the pattern of the ALGOL 60 language. Wirth was
        involved in the process to improve the language as part of the ALGOL X
        efforts and proposed a version known as ALGOL W. This was not accepted,
        and the ALGOL X process bogged down. In 1968, Wirth decided to abandon
        the ALGOL X process and further improve ALGOL W, releasing this as
        Pascal in 1970.
